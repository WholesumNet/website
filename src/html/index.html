                <b>Wholesum</b> is a p2p verifiable computing network. It builds on top of <u>Risc0</u>, <u>Swarm</u>, <u>FairOS-dfs</u>, and <u>Libp2p</u> to scale verifiable computing. 
            </p>
            <p>
                The network is compesed of at least 3 types of nodes:<br/>
                <ul>
                    <li>"Clients" who need computational resources.</li>
                    <li>"Servers" that offer their powerful computers in exchange for money along with proofs of honest execution.
                    </li>
                    <li>"Verifiers", that verify an execution session given a receipt.
                </ul>
                Communications between nodes are routed through p2p relays(nodes) where a message indicates a need(e.g. I need a computer with the following specs by client 0xfoo), a status update, ... . Two modes of messaging are supported: <i>gossips</i> that are broadcast-like(one to all/many) public messages and <i>request-response</i> that are private messages between two nodes.
            </p>
            <p>
                Building in p2p settings demands small payload messaging where the payload of a message points to heavy objects stored somewhere else. In Wholesum, nodes first store sizeable objecs into decentralized storage facilities of Swarm network and FairOS-dfs and then share CIDs with each other.
            </p>
            <p>
                Each execution session(a job) yields a "receipt of honest execution" along with usual outputs and logs. The receipt is then broadcasted to the network for independent verification and based on the results a client decides to wether accept the honesty or not. Once the job is done, server(s) and verifier(s) are paid and the actual results are harvested by the client.
